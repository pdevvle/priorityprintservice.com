# PPS Product Calculators

WordPress/WooCommerce plugin for Priority Print Service — pricing calculators with integrated artwork proofing.

## Architecture
- Self-contained React calculators (HTML files with inline Babel)
- PHP plugin handles cart, orders, REST API, SEO, Google Drive, tooltips
- All calculators share: shipping/rush engine, zone map, RichTip tooltips, debug panel, DatePicker
- Logo loaded from PPS_CONFIG.logoUrl (injected by PHP, not embedded)
- Zone map embedded in HTML for standalone testing, overridden by PHP in production

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `calc-preview-test.html` | Saddle stitch booklet calculator — most mature, has full proof/preview modals, approval package generation, magnifier, 3D book preview |
| `calc-perfect-bound.html` | Perfect bound booklet calculator — mixed color per-set, perfect binding labor, outfold, perforation, finishing cuts |
| `calc-brochure.html` | Brochure & flat printing calculator — 9 fold types, 3D fold preview (7 proven fold renderers), SheetPreview with front/back upload |
| `brochure-fold-previewer.html` | Reference: standalone 3D fold previewer tool (vanilla JS, 1453 lines). Source for the proven fold rendering engine now integrated into calc-brochure.html |
| `pps-calculators.php` | WP plugin: cart/orders, SEO schemas (Product/LocalBusiness/FAQ/WebApp/BreadcrumbList), preset routing + virtual-post render, per-preset SEO emission + dedupe filters, sitemap providers (WP/Yoast/RM), noscript fallback, llms.txt with presets section, reorder, edit mode, PPS-Spec/PPS-Production-Start for Missive, per-product defaults, tooltips injection, logo URL |
| `pps-config-admin.php` | Admin config page with tabs: Production, Papers, Finishing, Artwork, Sizes, Shipping, SEO (GBP rating + per-calc-type FAQs) |
| `pps-presets-admin.php` | Admin CRUD for `wp_options['pps_presets']` — list view + edit form. Each preset gets fields (slug, calc, title, desc, image, price_from, currency, defaults JSON) plus collapsible accordions for Tier 1 field overrides, Tier 2 schema-block overrides, Tier 3 extra schema blocks, and per-preset FAQ override. |
| `pps-gdrive.php` | Google Drive OAuth (credentials in wp_options, not source code), artwork upload with idempotent retry, thumbnail generation |
| `ups-zone-map-seed.json` | UPS Ground transit days by 3-digit ZIP prefix (1000 entries) |

## Shared Components (in each calculator HTML)
- `PCF` — pricing constants object, overridable via PPS_CONFIG.calc
- `calculate()` — pricing engine (different per product type)
- `Panel` — price/qty/availability display (desktop sidebar + mobile compact)
- `Sel`, `Pil`, `TxtNum`, `Sec` — form components matching Astra theme style
- `TurnBadge` — turnaround impact badges (magenta, "+N days")
- `RichTip` — media-rich tooltips (text/image/video/youtube), reads from PPS_CONFIG.tips via tipKey
- `InfoTip` — simple text tooltips (legacy, still used in proof modal)
- `DatePicker` — custom calendar with rush zone coloring
- `FitToggle` — art transform controls (Crop/Fill/Fit/Stretch/Scale/Rotate 90°)
- `DebugPanel` — calculation breakdown with turnaround/shipping/SEO schema debug
- Zone map (1000 entries) embedded inline, overridden by PHP

## PHP Plugin Key Features
- **Presets** (`wp_options['pps_presets']`): each row publishes a public URL at `/booklets/{slug}/` that renders the appropriate calculator with `PPS_CONFIG.defaults` populated. Routing via rewrite rule + `pps_preset` query var; virtual `WP_Post` injected via `the_posts`; calculator HTML rendered via `the_content` filter. Cart line items capture `_pps_preset_slug` for analytics. Preset CRUD lives in pps-presets-admin.php.
- **Per-preset SEO**: when on a preset URL, plugin emits per-preset `<title>`, meta description, canonical, robots, OG (5 tags), Twitter Card (4 tags), Product/BreadcrumbList/LocalBusiness/FAQ/WebApplication JSON-LD, plus a noscript fallback in the footer. Dedupe filters at priority 999 force Yoast / Rank Math output to match (covers `wpseo_title|metadesc|canonical|robots|opengraph_*|twitter_*` and `rank_math/frontend/title|description|canonical|robots`).
- **Schema overrides per preset** (three tiers): Tier 1 simple field overrides (meta_title, meta_description, og_image, schema_name, schema_sku, breadcrumb_label); Tier 2 per-block JSON-LD wholesale replacement (product, breadcrumb, localbusiness, faq, webapp); Tier 3 arbitrary additional JSON-LD blocks. Override-derived emission uses `JSON_HEX_TAG` to escape `<` and `>` for script-tag-breakout protection. Per-preset FAQ override available alongside calc-type defaults.
- **Sitemaps**: `PPS_Presets_Sitemap_Provider` registered with WP core sitemaps; when Yoast active, `wpseo_sitemap_index` filter adds `/pps-presets-sitemap.xml` reference; when Rank Math active, `rank_math/sitemap/index/entries` filter does the same. Custom XML at `/pps-presets-sitemap.xml` is the single source of truth.
- SEO: suppresses WooCommerce/Yoast/Rank Math/AIOSEO/SEOPress Product schemas on calculator pages AND preset URLs (via `pps_is_calculator_owned_url()`), injects own Product+LocalBusiness+FAQ+WebApp+BreadcrumbList schemas via `pps_emit_*_schema()` helpers (parameterized)
- LocalBusiness `aggregateRating` populated from Google Business Profile rating mirrored manually in the SEO admin tab (`seo.gbp_rating_value`, `seo.gbp_review_count`, `seo.gbp_url`); only emitted when both rating and review count are valid (rating in (0, 5], count > 0).
- FAQ schema is calc-type-aware (saddle/perfect-bound/brochure/coupon). Defaults live in `pps_default_faqs()`; admin overrides stored in `wp_options['pps_faqs']` keyed by calc type. Calc types with no defaults and no saved entries emit no FAQ `<script>` (better than emitting wrong-calc FAQs).
- Noscript fallback with static content for crawlers (calculator product pages AND preset URLs — preset version pulls title + description + spec table from the preset row)
- llms.txt endpoint at /llms.txt for AI search engines, with a "## Presets" section listing every preset URL + description
- Order meta: PPS-Spec (pipe-delimited spec string) and PPS-Production-Start for Missive parsing
- Edit mode: atomic add-before-remove for cart item updates
- Reorder: base64-encoded config in URL, restores all settings including artwork path
- Per-product defaults: "PPS Defaults" tab in WooCommerce product editor
- Tooltips: centralized in `wp_options['pps_tooltips']`, AJAX-saved (no admin tab UI in this repo), injected as PPS_CONFIG.tips
- GDrive: credentials in wp_options (not source), idempotent upload with retry, artwork path preserved for reorder

## Security (audited, 33+ bugs fixed)
- No credentials in source code (OAuth moved to wp_options)
- All POST handlers have nonce verification
- All admin functions have current_user_can checks
- REST API endpoints require is_user_logged_in
- OAuth flow has CSRF state parameter
- All user input escaped on output (esc_html, esc_url)
- Path traversal checked on artwork paths
- CSV parser bounded against DoS (max 999 ZIP prefix)
- img.onerror on all Image() constructors
- FileReader.onerror on all FileReader instances
- resp.ok check on fetch before .json() parse
- parseInt NaN validation on URL params
- Reorder type coercion (Number() on all numeric, strict boolean)
- Edit mode atomicity (add before remove)

## Branch & Deploy

- **Pages source branch:** `pps-pricing-config` — GitHub Pages serves directly from the root of this branch. All calculator changes must be pushed here. No separate deploy step.
- **`.nojekyll` is MANDATORY** on `pps-pricing-config`. Without it, Pages runs Jekyll, which silently breaks the build because the inline JSX/Babel inside the calculator HTML contains `{{ }}` that Jekyll tries to parse as Liquid templates. Symptom: your pushes never appear on the preview URL even though the file on GitHub looks correct. **Never delete `.nojekyll`.**
- Do NOT push to `website` — it's unrelated to the preview.
- **Preview URLs** (served by GitHub Pages from `pps-pricing-config`):
  - https://pdevvle.github.io/priorityprintservice.com/calc-preview-test.html (saddle stitch)
  - https://pdevvle.github.io/priorityprintservice.com/calc-perfect-bound.html (perfect bound)
  - https://pdevvle.github.io/priorityprintservice.com/calc-brochure.html (brochure)
  - https://pdevvle.github.io/priorityprintservice.com/calc-coupon-book.html (coupon book)
- Each calculator has a build-stamp chip in the bottom-right corner. After a push, wait ~60 seconds for Pages to rebuild, then hard-refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) or use an Incognito window. If the chip still doesn't update, verify `.nojekyll` exists on `pps-pricing-config` root — that's the #1 cause of "my push didn't show up."
- Go private protocol: replace files with dummies, flip repo to private. Restore: `git checkout pps-real-backup -- <files>`
